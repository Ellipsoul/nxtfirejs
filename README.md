# Online Blogging Web App

This project was completed for *educational purposes* (^^) following a tutorial by [Fireship](https://fireship.io/). It is a very simple blogging platform in the style of [DEV](https://dev.to/) where users can create an account, read posts, and write/edit posts supporting markdown and image uploads.
